# Router Connection Debug

## What You Told Me:
- **IP Address**: 10.0.0.1 ✅
- **Username**: admin ✅  
- **Password**: mnbv ✅
- **API Port**: 8728 ✅ (enabled)

## What I Did:
1. ✅ Updated your router settings in the system
2. ❌ Connection test still fails

## Possible Reasons & Quick Fixes:

### 1. Network Issue (Most Common)
**Problem**: Your payment system and router are on different networks
**Quick Test**: Can you ping the router from your computer?
- Open command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux)
- Type: `ping 10.0.0.1`
- Should see replies if network is good

### 2. Firewall Blocking
**Problem**: Router firewall blocking port 8728
**Quick Fix**: In your router, check:
- IP → Firewall → Filter Rules
- Make sure port 8728 is not blocked

### 3. API Service Check
**Problem**: API might not be fully enabled
**Quick Double-Check**: In your router:
- IP → Services → API
- Make sure "Available From" is set to "0.0.0.0/0" (or blank)
- Make sure "Port" is exactly 8728

### 4. Router Restart Needed
**Problem**: Router needs restart after enabling API
**Quick Fix**: 
- In router web interface: System → Reboot
- Or unplug router for 10 seconds, plug back in

## Let's Test Step by Step:

### Test 1: Can you access router web page?
Try going to: `http://10.0.0.1` in your browser
**Result**: Can you still login? Yes/No: _______

### Test 2: Check API settings again
In your router:
- IP → Services → API  
- What does "Available From" show? _______
- What does "Port" show? _______

### Test 3: Simple network test
From your computer, can you ping the router?
- Command: `ping 10.0.0.1`
**Result**: Do you see replies? Yes/No: _______

## What Happens When It Works:

Once the connection succeeds:
- ✅ Router test will show "Success" 
- ✅ When customers pay, they automatically get internet
- ✅ You see all activity in admin dashboard
- ✅ Money flows to your M-Pesa account

The payment system is working perfectly (customers are already paying), we just need this final connection to complete the circle!
