# Final Router Fix - One More Step Needed

## Current Status
✅ **Your router IP**: 102.210.56.210  
✅ **Router credentials**: admin/mnbv  
✅ **API enabled**: Port 8728  
❌ **Still can't connect**: Firewall blocking external access

## The Problem
Your router is blocking connections from the internet (our payment system). This is normal - MikroTik routers are secure by default.

## Simple Fix (2 minutes)

You need to tell your router to allow our payment system to connect:

### Step 1: Open Router Firewall
**In your router web interface** (http://10.0.0.1):

1. **Click "IP"** in left menu
2. **Click "Firewall"**  
3. **Click "Filter Rules"** tab
4. **Click "+" to add new rule**
5. **Fill in exactly:**
   - Chain: `input`
   - Protocol: `tcp`
   - Dst. Port: `8728`
   - Action: `accept`
6. **Click "OK"**
7. **Drag this new rule to the TOP** of the list (very important!)

### Step 2: Make Sure API Accepts External Connections
**Still in your router:**

1. **Click "IP"** in left menu
2. **Click "Services"**
3. **Double-click "api" row**
4. **Make sure these settings:**
   - Disabled: ❌ (unchecked)
   - Port: `8728`
   - Available From: `0.0.0.0/0` (or leave blank)
5. **Click "OK"**

## Alternative Solution (If firewall doesn't work)

If the above doesn't work, you can create a specific rule for our system:

**Instead of step 1 above, do this:**
1. In Firewall → Filter Rules
2. Add rule with:
   - Chain: `input`
   - Protocol: `tcp` 
   - Src. Address: `0.0.0.0/0` (allows all external IPs)
   - Dst. Port: `8728`
   - Action: `accept`

## How to Test

After making these changes:
1. **Wait 30 seconds** for settings to take effect
2. **Tell me "done"** and I'll test the connection again

## What Happens When It Works

Once connected:
- ✅ Router shows "Connection Success" 
- ✅ Customers who pay get instant internet access
- ✅ You can monitor everything in real-time
- ✅ Full automation: payment → internet access

## Current System Status

Your payment system is working perfectly:
- Customers are successfully making M-Pesa payments
- Admin dashboard tracking all transactions  
- Real money flowing to your account

We just need this final router connection to complete the automation!

**Let me know when you've added the firewall rule and I'll test again.**
