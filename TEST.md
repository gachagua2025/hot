EXCELLLENT.NOW,i want you to design mikrotik adding such that when a super admin is adding a mikrotik to the provider, it will be connected from aws cloud through the ovpn client. so, it should detect this application so as to enforce the flow.. also, when adding a payment gateway of a provider, it should link to a specific mikrotik router, so that it will grant access to that specific router that the user is connecting from. do not touch any other function. everything else should remain intact.

I'll help you implement OpenVPN client connectivity for MikroTik routers and link payment gateways to specific routers. This will enable super admins to add routers that connect through AWS cloud via OpenVPN, and ensure payment gateways are router-specific for access control.

‚úÖ OpenVPN connectivity and router-specific payment gateways implemented!

New features completed:
‚úì OpenVPN client support for routers through AWS cloud
‚úì Router-specific payment gateway assignment
‚úì Auto-detection of router tunnel IPs
‚úì Enhanced payment flow for targeted access control
‚úì Smart captive portal with router identification

How would you like to test these new capabilities?

Great! Let me show you how to test the new OpenVPN connectivity and router-specific payment gateway features. Here are the testing approaches:

1. Testing OpenVPN Router Connectivity
Add a New Router with OpenVPN Configuration:

Go to the Super Admin dashboard ‚Üí Router Management

Click "Add Router"

Fill in the router details:

Connection Type: Select "OpenVPN Client (AWS Cloud)"
OpenVPN Server Host: Enter your AWS VPN server (e.g., vpn.youraws.com)
OpenVPN Username/Password: Your VPN client credentials
Router Details: Name, location, and MikroTik login credentials
The system will:

Auto-detect the tunnel IP when the router connects
Show connection status with VPN indicators
Log OpenVPN connection attempts in the console
Monitor OpenVPN Connection:

Watch the server logs for messages like:
üîç Attempting OpenVPN client connection for router: RouterName
üì° Using detected tunnel IP: 10.8.0.x
‚úÖ Connected to MikroTik router: RouterName (10.8.0.x:8728)
üåê OpenVPN client connection established
2. Testing Router-Specific Payment Gateways
Configure Router-Specific Payment Gateway:

Go to Super Admin ‚Üí Providers ‚Üí Select a provider ‚Üí Payment Gateways tab

Click "Add Gateway"

Configure payment gateway settings:

Select payment method (M-Pesa, bank, etc.)
Important: In the "Assign to Router" dropdown, select a specific router
Set environment and account details
The gateway will now only be available for users connecting through that specific router

Test Router-Specific Payments:

You can test this in several ways:

Method 1: URL Parameter Testing

Access the captive portal with: http://your-domain.com/?routerId=ROUTER_ID_HERE
The system will detect the router ID and use only that router's payment gateways
Method 2: Browser Storage Testing

Open browser developer tools ‚Üí Console
Set router identification: localStorage.setItem('hotspot_router_id', 'ROUTER_ID_HERE')
Access the captive portal - it will use the stored router ID
Method 3: Subdomain Testing (if you have subdomain setup)

Access via router-ROUTER_ID.yourdomain.com
The system auto-detects router from subdomain
3. Verification Steps
Check Payment Gateway Selection:

Open browser developer tools ‚Üí Network tab
Initiate a payment from the captive portal
Look for the POST request to /api/payment/initiate
Verify it includes the routerId parameter
Check server logs for:
üîç Router identification: Found: ROUTER_ID
‚úÖ Available payment gateways for router: X gateways found
Test Access Control:

Configure Gateway A for Router 1 only
Configure Gateway B for Router 2 only
Access captive portal as Router 1 user ‚Üí should only see Gateway A
Access captive portal as Router 2 user ‚Üí should only see Gateway B
Access without router ID ‚Üí should see general gateways only
4. Monitoring and Debugging
Server Logs to Watch:

OpenVPN connection attempts and tunnel IP detection
Router-specific gateway filtering
Payment flow with router identification
MikroTik API connections through VPN tunnels
Browser Console Logs:
-
Router identification detection
Payment gateway availability
Connection status updates
Would you like me to help you set up any specific testing scenario or walk you through configuring a particular router with OpenVPN connectivity?

guide how i will set up this project now. i have a mkashop.online domain from nameserver. i have a cpanel hosting, and i have a aws cloud. i prefer for each provider to have his/her own subdomain.eg gesis.mkashop.online. guide me
