```

## Finding Your Router's VPN IP Address

### Method 1: Admin Panel

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### OpenVPN Client Won't Connect
```
Problem: Connection fails or times out
Solutions:
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify firewall allows OpenVPN (port 1194 UDP)
3. Try different network (mobile hotspot)
4. Re-download .ovpn file from admin panel
```

### Can't Access Router After VPN Connection
```
Problem: VPN connects but can't reach router
Solutions:
1. Verify router's VPN status in admin panel
2. Check if router shows "Connected" status
3. Try pinging VPN IP: ping 10.8.0.50
4. Restart router's OpenVPN client interface
```

### Router Loses VPN Connection
```
Problem: Router disconnects from VPN frequently
Solutions:
1. Check router's internet connection stability
2. Verify OpenVPN client interface is enabled
3. Check RouterOS logs for error messages
4. Regenerate OpenVPN configuration if needed
```

### Multiple Routers Same VPN IP
```
Problem: Two routers get same IP address
Solution:
1. Each router gets unique VPN IP automatically
2. If conflict occurs, regenerate config for one router
3. Check admin panel for IP conflicts
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. VPN Connection Security
```
- Always verify you're connected to correct VPN
- Disconnect VPN when not needed to save bandwidth
- Use strong passwords for RouterOS accounts
- Keep OpenVPN client software updated
```

### 2. Router Access Security
```
- Change default RouterOS passwords
- Use strong admin passwords
- Enable router firewall rules
- Monitor access logs regularly
```

### 3. Certificate Management
```
- Keep certificate files secure
- Don't share .ovpn files with unauthorized users
- Regenerate certificates if compromised
- Regular certificate rotation (recommended annually)
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Auto-Connect on Startup
```
Windows:
- OpenVPN Connect: Enable "Auto-connect" option
- OpenVPN GUI: Place .ovpn in auto-connect folder

Linux:
- Add to systemd service for automatic connection
- Use NetworkManager for GUI auto-connect

Mac:
- Tunnelblick: Set "Connect when Tunnelblick launches"
```

### Multiple Router Management
```
1. Each router gets unique VPN IP
2. Import multiple .ovpn profiles
3. Connect to specific router's VPN as needed
4. Use router naming convention for easy identification
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Check Connection Status
```
1. Admin Panel Method:
   - Login to admin panel
   - Check router status in Routers section
   - Green "VPN" badge indicates connected

2. Router Method:
   - Access router via Winbox/WebFig
   - Go to Interfaces → OpenVPN Client
   - Check status shows "Connected"
```

### Performance Monitoring
```
- Monitor VPN bandwidth usage
- Check connection latency (ping times)
- Review RouterOS logs for issues
- Test connection speed through VPN
```
